! Data Tiddlers

As mentioned in the second paragraph, data-tiddlers are "candidate for deprecation" in 5.''2''.x. 

5.''2''.x in TW versioning means: NEXT MAJOR VERSION. 

So data tiddlers will be part of 5.1.x "for ever" because of the "compatibility" philosophy BUT it's use is discouraged.

As you may recall, my view on data tiddlers has evolved over the years, and I broadly no longer think they were a good idea. The present implementation is limited, and would take a lot of code and complexity to make it universal. The implementation of data tiddlers is spread throughout the core code, and hard to work with. I think that the whole idea was misguided: it was an attempt to avoid the proliferation of tiddlers, but I now think that that is a non-goal.

Against that background, I think of data tiddlers as a candidate for deprecation in v5.2.x, and so I'm reluctant to expand support at this point. It looks like this operator could be delivered as a plugin, which I think is what I would advise at this point ...
