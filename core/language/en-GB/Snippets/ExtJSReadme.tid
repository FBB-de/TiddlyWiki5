To ensure that the "save snapshot for offline use" button saves a working wiki, it is also necessary to set the tiddler $:/config/SaveWikiButton/Template to contain <code>~$:/core/save/<b>offline-external-js</b></code>. You must also save a copy of  "tiddlywiki5.js" in the same folder as your offline wiki file. See [[How to obtain tiddlywiki5.js|$:/language/Snippets/GetTiddlyWikiJS]] for details.

!! Upgrading

Upgrading an offline wiki with an external-js template will be a three-step process:

# Follow the standalone file ~TiddlyWiki Upgrading process. Your wiki will be converted to a full standalone version.

# Open $:/language/Snippets/GetTiddlyWikiJS tiddler from your newly upgraded wiki and click the "Export tiddlywiki5.js" button.

# Verify that $:/config/SaveWikiButton/Template still contains `$:/core/save/offline-external-js`. Save your wiki again and the wiki will be converted to using the external-js template.
